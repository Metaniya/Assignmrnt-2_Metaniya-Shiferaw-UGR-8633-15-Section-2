Deployment Issues
The homepage is running fine on the server, but I'm currently facing issues with linking the About Us and Contact Us pages.
These pages work perfectly on my local machine, but they aren't displaying correctly on the server. I'm still working on fixing the issue.
I didn't resubmit the published file on the Google form link since I can't fix all the issues, but you can check the Deployment here: (https://metaniya.github.io/Assignmrnt-2_Metaniya-Shiferaw-UGR-8633-15-Section-2/) to see what I'm able to fix and can successfully run.
